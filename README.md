# 👋 Hey, I'm Siddhant Patil

🎓 **Master’s in Computer Science @ CSULB**  
🧠 **Ex–Software Engineer at Humancloud | AI/LLM Engineer | Full Stack Builder**  
🌉 Now building data-driven and agentic systems that turn automation into real business leverage.

## 🧩 What I Do

I design and ship intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and scale — blending backend engineering with applied AI.  
My work lives at the intersection of **LLM infrastructure, data validation, and real-time automation**, where reliability matters as much as intelligence.

Beyond code, I’m deeply involved in the **Silicon Valley startup community**, exploring how AI-first companies can balance speed, privacy, and trust while scaling globally.
